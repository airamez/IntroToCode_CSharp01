/*
 * The recursion definition is very siple: A routine can call itself
 * - Direct recursion is when a routine call itself directly
 * - Undirect recursion is when a routine call other routine and
 *   in some point the initial routine is called again
 * - Concepts:
 *   - Every recursion must have a stop condition
 *     - Usually called: base case or base condition
 *   - While the stop condition is not reached the routine
 *     execution is stacked
 *   - Many data-structures and advanced algorithm use recursion
