# What is a Stack?
  # A stack is a type of data structure that stores elements in a sequence which is enforced by the operations used.
  # It follows the LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) methodology, meaning the data that gets in last, gets out first.
  # The process to add an element into stack is called push, and to remove an element from the stack is called pop.
# Key Operations
  # Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.
  # Pop: Remove an element from the top of the stack.
  # IsEmpty: Check if the stack is empty.
  # IsFull: Check if the stack is full.
  # Length/Size
  # Peek/Top: Get the value of the top of the stack without removing it.

# Real World Examples of Stacks
  # Back Button in Web Browsers
  # Undo Functionality
  # Expression Evaluation ((x + 3) + (y / 2))
  # Memory Management
