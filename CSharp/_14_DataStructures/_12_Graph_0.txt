# Definition:
  # A graph is a non-linear data structure composed of vertices (also called nodes) and 
    edges that connect pairs of vertices.
  # Vertices represent entities, and edges represent relationships or connections between them.
# Components:
  # Vertices (Nodes): Represent entities or objects.
  # Edges: Connect vertices and represent relationships.
# Types of Graphs:
  # Undirected Graphs: Edges have no direction (e.g., social network friendships).
  # Directed Graphs (Digraphs): Edges have a direction (e.g., web page links).
  # Weighted Graphs: Edges have associated weights or costs (e.g., road networks).
  # Unweighted Graphs: Edges have no weights (e.g., social networks).
  # Complete Graphs: Every vertex is connected to every other vertex.
  # Trees: Connected graphs with no cycles.
  # Cycles: Graphs with at least one cycle.
# Applications:
  # Computer Networks: Represent network topology.
  # Social Media: Connections between users.
  # Routing Algorithms: Find shortest paths.
  # Recommendation Systems: Suggest related items.
  # Dependency Resolution: Model dependencies between tasks/events.
  # Graph Databases: Store and query complex relationships.
