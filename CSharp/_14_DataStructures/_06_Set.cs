/*
# Set
  # A Set is a collection of distinct elements.
  # Each element in a Set is unique.
  # The order of elements in a Set is not guaranteed.
  # Basic Operations
    # Add: Insert an element into the Set. 
      If the element already exists, the Set remains unchanged.
    # Remove: Remove an element from the Set.
      If the element does not exist, the Set remains unchanged.
    # Contains: Check if an element exists in the Set.
    # Size: Get the number of elements in the Set.
    # Iterate: Traverse through the elements in the Set.
  # Set operation
    # Intersection
    # Union
    # Difference
  # Use Cases
    # Sets are used when you want to avoid duplicate elements and 
      when you donâ€™t care about the order of elements.
    # They are often used for operations like union, intersection,
      and set difference.
