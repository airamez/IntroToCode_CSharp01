/*
 # Method overriding is a feature that allows a subclass (derived or child class) 
   to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided
   by one of its superclasses or parent classes.
 # The implementation in the subclass overrides (replaces) the implementation 
   in the superclass by providing a method that has the same name, same parameters
   or signature, and same return type as the method in the parent class.
 # Method overriding is useful to implement polymorfism
 # In C# there are three keywords for overriding implementation:
   # virtual: used on the base class to indicate that overriding is possible
   # override: used in the subclass to indicate a method is being overriden
   # new: Used in the subclass to indicate the method is NOT being overriden

 # Class Content:
   # Demo with a base class with two methods and
     a Sub class using override and new for those methods.
   # Show the result of calling the methods using a reference
     for the base class
