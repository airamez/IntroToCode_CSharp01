 - The if statement is a conditioning (selection) statement that allow the execution of parts of the program (CODE BLOCK)
   depending on Logical Expressions values

 - CODE BLOCK
   - A CODE BLOCK is a group of coding statements (commands)
   - A CODE BLOCK is delimited by the '{' and '}' characters
     - There is an exception if there is only one command. (Bad practices)

 Syntax:
    if (LOGICAL_EXPRESSION) {
        LOGICAL_EXPRESSION is TRUE
    }

    if (LOGICAL_EXPRESSION) {
        LOGICAL_EXPRESSION is TRUE
    }
    else {
        LOGICAL_EXPRESSION is FALSE
    }

    if (LOGICAL_EXPRESSION_1) {
        LOGICAL_EXPRESSION_1 is TRUE
    }
    else if (LOGICAL_EXPRESSION_2) {
        LOGICAL_EXPRESSION_2 is TRUE
    }
    else if (LOGICAL_EXPRESSION_3) {
        LOGICAL_EXPRESSION_3 is TRUE
    }

    if (LOGICAL_EXPRESSION_1) {
        LOGICAL_EXPRESSION_1 is TRUE
    }
    else if (LOGICAL_EXPRESSION_2) {
        LOGICAL_EXPRESSION_2 is TRUE
    }
    else if (LOGICAL_EXPRESSION_3) {
        LOGICAL_EXPRESSION_3 is TRUE
    } else {
        All LOGICAL_EXPRESSIONS are false
    }
