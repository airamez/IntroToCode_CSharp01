# Indexers allow instances of a class or struct to be indexed just like arrays.

# Indexers resemble properties except that their accessors take parameters.
# An indexer is a special type of property that allows a class or a structure
  to be accessed like an array for its internal collection.
# An indexer can be defined the same way as property with this keyword and
  square brackets []
