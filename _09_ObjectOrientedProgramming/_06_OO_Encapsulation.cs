# Encapsulation is the wrapping up of data and information inside a class,
  and offer methods to access them.
# It is achieved by declaring variables as private and using properties
  to access them.
# There are four access modifiers that can be used to control the visibility:
   public: Anywhere
   private: Only inside the class
   protected: Only inside the class and sub-classes
   internal: Only inside the same Assembly (EXE, DLL or Project)
# Class Content:
  # 1. Review Name Space
  # 2. Create a new class Car
