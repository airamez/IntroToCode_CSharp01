/*
# Operator overloading allows a user-defined type to define the behavior
   of an operator when applied to its instances.
# A user-defined type can overload a predefined C# operator. That is, a 
  type can provide the custom implementation of an operation in case one
  or both of the operands are of that type.
# The operator keyword is used to declare an operator.
# An operator declaration must include both a public and a static modifier.
# A unary operator has one input parameter, while a binary operator has two
  input parameters.
# In each case, at least one parameter must have type T or T? where T is
  the type that contains the operator declaration.
# The following table shows the operators that can be overloaded:
Operators	                              Notes
+x, -x, !x, ~x	                           Unary operators
++, --                                    Increment and decrement operators
+, -, *, /, %, &, |, ^, <<, >>            Arithmetic and bitwise operators
==, !=, <, >, <=, >=	                     Comparison operators
+=, -=, *=, /=, %=, &=, |=, ^=, <<=, >>=  Compound assignment operators
