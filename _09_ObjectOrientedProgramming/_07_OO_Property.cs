# Properties are used to encapsulate fields and provide a way to access them.
# They are similar to methods, but they are accessed like fields.
# There are two types of properties: auto-implemented properties and custom properties.
# Auto-implemented properties have a get and a set accessor, but no implementation. 
  The compiler will automatically generate a backing field for the property.
# Custom properties have a get and a set accessor, and a custom implementation. 
  This allows you to perform additional logic when the property is accessed or modified.

# Class Content:
  # 1. Attribute with Set and Get
  # 2. Custom Property
  # 3. Auto-implemented Property
  # 4. Auto-implemented Property with "expression-bodied syntax"
