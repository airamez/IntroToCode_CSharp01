/*
# An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated.
  It can only be used as a base class for other classes.
# An abstract class can contain abstract methods (methods without a body)
  and non-abstract methods (methods with a body).
# A derived class that inherits from an abstract class must implement all
  the abstract methods declared in the base class.
# An abstract method can only be present inside an abstract class.
# When a non-abstract class inherits an abstract class, it should 
  provide an implementation of the abstract methods.
# The abstract keyword is used to create an abstract class or method.
# An abstract class can have access modifiers like
  public, private, protected, etc.
# An abstract class can have fields, properties, constructors, 
  events, indexers, operators, finalizers, and static constructors.
# An abstract class can inherit from another abstract class 
  or a non-abstract class.
# An abstract class can implement an interface.
# An abstract class can not be sealed.
