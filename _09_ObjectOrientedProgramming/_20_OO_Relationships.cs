/*
# Relationship is a way to describe how one class is connected to another class.
# Consequently, how object are connected as well.
# There are several types of relationships between classes:
  # Direct reference: In this type of relationship, one class has a direct 
    reference to another class. 
  # Association: This is a more general relationship between classes.
    # It simply means that two classes are related in some way. 
    # The association can be:
      # One to One: 1:1
      # One to Many: 1:N
      # Many to Many1: N:N
  # Aggregation: This is a type of association where one class is a part of 
    another class. For example, if you have a Person class and an Address class,
    you might say that a Person has an aggregation relationship with an Address.
  # Composition: This is a stronger form of aggregation where one class is composed
    of one or more other classes. For example, if you have a Car class and classes 
    Wheel, Engine and Transmission, you might say that a Car has a composition
    relationship with these classes.
