# Software Testing
  # Software testing is the critical process of evaluating and validating software
    to ensure its functionality, reliability, and meet the requirements.
  # Software testing is like checking a cake you baked to make sure it tastes good,
    looks right, and follows the recipe.
    It helps find any mistakes or problems before serving it to others.
  # A significat part of the cost with software are related to testing.
  # It is a vast and complex topic and there are multiple typs of testing.
    # Unit: Verifies individual code components (like functions or methods) in isolation.
    # Integration: Ensures that different parts of the software work together seamlessly.
    # System: Validates the entire software system against requirements.
    # Functional: Checks if software functions as expected based on business logic.
    # Acceptance: Determines if the software meets user expectations.
    # Regression: Ensures existing functionality remains intact after code changes.
    # Performance: Evaluate how well the software performs under specific conditions.
    # Scaling: Determine how the system scales as user/data load increases.
# Unit Testing
  # Unit testing is a fundamental practice in software development where individual
    components (such as functions or methods) are tested in isolation to ensure they
    function correctly.
  # Purpose
    # Identify and fix issues early in the development process.
    # Enhance overall software quality by validating each code unit.
    # Isolate specific sections of code for correctness testing.
  # Performed By
    # Primarily done by developers.
  # Advantages
    # Early bug detection.
    # Improved code quality.
    # Simplified debugging.
    # Clear documentation of functionality.
  # Execution
    # Automatic and usually integrated on build/release process (CI/CD)
    # Run before integration testing.
  # Tools
    # Unit testing frameworks:
      # MSTest: Microsoftâ€™s built-in testing framework for .NET.
      # NUnit: Open-source testing framework with a rich feature set.
      # xUnit: Open-source framework designed for extensibility.
    # Mocking frameworks:
      # Moq
      # NSubstitute
      # FakeItEasy
