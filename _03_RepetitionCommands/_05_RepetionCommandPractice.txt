- Create a program to:
01. Print the numbers from 1 to 1000 without using new lines after each number.
02. Read two integer numbers representing an interval and print all numbers inside the interval.
03. Read two integer numbers representing an interval and print all even numbers inside the interval.
04. Read integer numbers (flag = empty) and print the average.
05. Read integer numbers (flag = empty) and print the highest value.
06. Read integer numbers (flag = empty) and print the two highest unique values.
07. Read integer numbers (flag = empty) and print the smallest value and it's frequency.
08. Print the Fibonacci sequence while the term is smaller than 5000.
    Fibonacci = 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
09. Print the multiplication table for numbers from 0 to 9.
    e.g.
    0 x 0 = 0
    0 x 1 = 0
    0 x 2 = 0
    ...
    0 x 9 = 0
    1 x 0 = 0
    1 x 1 = 1
    1 x 2 = 2
    ...
    1 x 9 = 9
    2 x 0 = 0
    2 x 1 = 2
    2 x 2 = 4
    ...
    9 x 9 = 81
10. Create a multiplication table game following the specification below:
    - The game must ask multiplication questions using random numbers from 0 to 9.
      e.g 3 x 9 = ?
          7 x 8 = ?
          0 x 2 = ?
          ...
    - The game ends when the user type an empty value or if the user get 5 wrong answers;
    - At the end of the game prints the score showing the number of right and wrong answers;
11. Read a integer number and calculate its Factorial. f(n) = n.(n-1).(n-2)(n-3)...1
    e.g
    f(0) = 1 (Exception)
    f(1) = 1
    f(2) = 2 x 1
    f(4) = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 48
    f(5) = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120
    f(6) = 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 720
12. Create a guessing game following the specification below:
    - Generate a random integer number from 1 to 100 (inclusive)
    - Let the user try to guess the number until it get the right number
    - For every guess the program should update the new interval
    - At the end, print how many tries the player used
    - e.g. Generated number = 35 (The player can't see this number)
    - If only one number left in the interval the player lose the game
      Try to guess a number from:
      1 to 100 => 20
      21 to 100 => 65
      21 to 64 => 30
      31 to 64 => 41
      31 to 40 => 36
      31 to 35 => 35
      Congratulations you guessed the right number with 6 attempts !
13. Read an integer number with any length and reverse it's digits.
    e.g
    Input = 12345
    Output = 54321
14. Read an integer number and determine if it is a prime number or not.
15. Read two integer numbers and calculate the "integer" division without use the division operator.
16. Read an integer number H and print H lines composed of * characters start with one character and adding one * for each new line.
    e.g.
    Height = 7
    *
    **
    ***
    ****
    *****
    ******
    *******
17. Same as the previous question but starting from the right.
    e.g.
    Height = 7
          *
         **
        ***
       ****
      *****
     ******
    *******
18. Read an integer number H and print a Christmas Tree with height H.
    e.g.
    Height = 7
          *
         ...
        .....
       .......
      .........
     ...........
    .............
          |
          |
19. Generated 10,000 random numbers from 1 to 5 and print how many times and the percentage of each numbers.
    e.g.
    1 = 200 times => 2%
    2 = 5000 times => 50%
    3 = 800 times => 8%
    4 = 1000 times => 10%
    5 = 3000 times => 30%
20. Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 each one in a new line.
    But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”.
    For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.
