    To determine whether a year is a leap year, follow these steps:
      1. If the year is evenly divisible by 4, go to step 2. Otherwise, go to step 5.
      2. If the year is evenly divisible by 100, go to step 3. Otherwise, go to step 4.
      3. If the year is evenly divisible by 400, go to step 4. Otherwise, go to step 5.
      4. The year is a leap year (it has 366 days).
      5. The year is not a leap year (it has 365 days).
18. Read the Name, Height and Gender (M = Male; F = Female) of a person
    and calculate the ideal weight using the rules below:
    - Male  : Ideal weight = (72.7 x Height) - 58
    - Female: Ideal weight = (62.1 x Height) - 44.7
    The height is in meters and the weight in kilograms
19. Read the values of the side of a triangle and print the type 
    of the triangle
    - Isosceles: Only two sides are equals
    - Scalene: All sides are different
    - Equilateral : All sides are equals
20. Read the name and salary of a employee and calculate the new salary based on the rules below:

     50,001 to 100,000     15%
     100,001 to 150,000    10%
     150,000 +              5%
     Print the name, raising % and the new Salary
